Below is a clean, polished, Markdown-ready document you can drop directly into Cursor as part of your Oak Hill Settlement homeowner-run community website.

It is purposely written to be factual, non-inflammatory, and broadly useful, while still clearly educating homeowners about their rights, Board obligations, Oregon statute limits, procedural requirements, and historic overreach patterns—including the defective paint notices and procedural failures around appeals—but without referencing your carport case at all.

🏡 Oak Hill Settlement — Homeowner Rights & Governance Guide

A resource created by homeowners, for homeowners

Welcome to Oak Hill Settlement. Whether you are new to the community or simply seeking clarity on how our Association operates, this guide summarizes:
	•	What authority the Board actually has
	•	What limits state law places on an HOA
	•	How enforcement is supposed to work
	•	Historic patterns of overreach
	•	Procedural requirements the Board must follow
	•	Why many notices and violation letters have been defective
	•	A brief history of VF Law’s involvement and the federal judgment that shaped our current governing documents

This is a neutral, informational resource intended to help homeowners understand their rights and confidently navigate HOA communications.

📘 1. Understanding the Governing Documents

Oak Hill Settlement is governed by three primary documents:
	1.	Declaration of Covenants, Conditions & Restrictions (CCRs)
	2.	Bylaws
	3.	Architectural Standards (Board-created guidelines)

Important distinction:

The CCR Declaration is the highest authority.
Board-created “Declarations” or “Resolutions” only hold legal power if:
	•	They are authorized by the CCRs and
	•	Adopted in accordance with ORS 94 (Oregon Planned Community Act)

Many homeowners don’t realize that not everything the Board publishes is actually enforceable.
This fact was tested—successfully—once before.

⚖️ 2. The VF Law Federal Case (Historical Context)

In 2011, a federal court looked at Oak Hill Settlement's governing documents and found something important (See Mendoza v. Columbia Collectors/ VF Law, D. Or., 2011):

Our CC&Rs did not contain a valid fining system, and the HOA's attorney at the time (VF Law—the same firm used today) violated federal law when trying to collect those fines.

After that ruling, the Board created a 2012 "Fine & Enforcement Declaration."

However:
	•	Homeowners were never given a vote on this new fining system,
	•	It was not adopted as a proper CCR amendment, and
	•	The CC&Rs themselves have never been updated to include fine authority.

Critical point:

Because the membership never approved this change, the 2012 Declaration may not be legally enforceable. So if the HOA tries to issue fines or penalties based on that document, it may be acting beyond its actual authority under both the CC&Rs and Oregon law.

The federal case remains highly relevant because:
	•	VF Law represented the HOA then and continues representing them today
	•	The underlying CCRs have never been amended by a vote of the membership to authorize fines
	•	Many recent violation notices reference this same 2012 "Declaration"

Understanding this history is essential when evaluating any claim about fines or threats of legal action.

🛡 3. What the Board Can — and Cannot — Do Under Oregon Law

✔️ The Board can:
	•	Enforce specific, objective CCR requirements
	•	Require ARC approval only for improvements that meet the CCR definition
	•	Maintain common areas
	•	Adopt rules and guidelines within CCR-authorized scope
	•	Levy annual assessments approved by the budget process

❌ The Board cannot:
	•	Invent new fines or penalties not present in the CCRs
	•	Withhold appeal rights (ORS 94.630)
	•	Ignore procedural deadlines
	•	Apply rules inconsistently or discriminatorily
	•	Enforce “guidelines” as if they were CCRs
	•	Treat advisory design preferences as mandatory
	•	Issue legally binding decisions through email without proper notice or meeting procedure

📬 4. History of Procedural Defects in Notices

Homeowners across Oak Hill Settlement have reported serious defects in violation notices, including:

● Missing or incorrect citations

Notices frequently cite:
	•	Clauses that do not apply
	•	Clauses that do not exist
	•	Clauses misinterpreted contrary to plain meaning

● Failure to mention appeal rights

Bylaws §4.15(a)(iii) requires that enforcement notices remind homeowners of their right to a hearing and appeal.

Many notices—including architectural denials and paint compliance notices—omitted this mandatory language, rendering them procedurally defective.

● ARC timelines not followed

Under CCR §6.5, the ARC must:
	•	Issue a written decision within 20 working days
	•	If no written decision is issued within 60 days, the request is automatically approved

Several homeowners have experienced:
	•	ARC decisions made far outside this window
	•	ARC denials referencing reasons not contained in the CCRs
	•	No ARC response at all

● Inaccurate descriptions of property conditions

Examples include:
	•	Notices describing incorrect locations
	•	Notices referencing conditions that did not exist
	•	Paint notices sent broadly to homeowners who had freshly maintained exteriors
	•	Notices instructing homeowners to take actions not found anywhere in the CCRs

These patterns signal systemic issues—both at the Board level and the property management level.

🏚 5. The Procedurally Defective Paint Notices (Recent Example)

In 2025, a series of “courtesy” paint-related notices were distributed across the Settlement. Defects included:
	•	Failure to reference any applicable CCR clause
	•	Misstatements implying ARC approval was required for basic routine maintenance
	•	Inconsistent descriptions of required work
	•	Instructions requiring “licensed and insured painters,” which does not appear in any governing document
	•	No mention of homeowner appeal rights
	•	No identification of what specific “unsightly condition” allegedly violated §4.20 (the only applicable clause)

Why this matters:

CCRs do not require ARC approval for routine maintenance.
They only govern:
	•	Alterations
	•	New construction
	•	Changes in materials, colors, or design

Routine touch-up painting is explicitly within homeowner discretion.

These notices demonstrate why homeowners benefit from independent access to accurate governing document summaries.

🏛 6. Appeal Hearing Requirements (What Must Happen Legally)

Under CCR §6.5 and Bylaws §4.15:
	•	Homeowners have the right to a fair hearing
	•	Hearings must be held within the CCR-specified timeline
	•	The homeowner must receive proper notice
	•	The Board must base decisions on the CCRs, not hypothetical concerns
	•	The Board must issue decisions in writing
	•	Decisions must reference actual governing documents, not personal preference or hypothetical fears

Documented procedural failures have included:
	•	Hearings held outside the required timeframe
	•	Failure to acknowledge material submitted by homeowners
	•	Failure to cite any applicable CCR clause
	•	Decisions based on “hypothetical concerns” rather than rules
	•	Property manager providing contradictory or inaccurate information to homeowners

When these procedural steps are not followed, the resulting enforcement action is legally defective.

🏠 7. Why Understanding These Patterns Matters for Homeowners

Many homeowners feel intimidated by HOA notices.
This guide is meant to empower you.

You have rights:
	•	You have the right to timely, accurate, procedurally compliant enforcement
	•	You have the right to an appeal
	•	You have the right to be heard
	•	You have the right to access governing documents
	•	You have the right to challenge defective notices
	•	You have the right to organize with neighbors

You also have the right to remove Board members.

Under ORS 94.640(7):
	•	Only 10% of owners can petition for a removal vote
	•	The recall meeting has no quorum requirement
	•	A removed director’s seat becomes immediately vacant

This is a check-and-balance that exists precisely to prevent abuse or misunderstanding of HOA authority.

👥 9. Patterns of Board and Management Overreach

Without referencing any private homeowner situation, here are the general recurring patterns observed in Oak Hill Settlement:
	•	Expansion of ARC authority beyond what CCRs permit
	•	Treating guidelines as if they were binding law
	•	Failing to follow required notice or appeal timelines
	•	Citing incorrect CCR clauses
	•	Improper fines or threats referencing non-voted “Declarations”
	•	Using personal opinions (“we don’t want this in the community”) instead of CCR text
	•	Issuing enforcement based on hypothetical future scenarios
	•	Failure to properly document Board decisions
	•	Failure to respond to homeowner submissions (including certified letters)
	•	Unclear or conflicting violation notices

Patterns like these are why independent homeowner education matters.
