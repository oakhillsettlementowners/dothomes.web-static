# ARC Requests, Violations & Appeals

This page explains how things *should* work versus how they’ve sometimes worked in practice.

---

## 1. ARC Requests — What Actually Needs Approval?

### ARC Approval Is Required When:

- You are **constructing, reconstructing, or materially altering** an improvement, and  
- There are **“construction plans and specifications”** involved (CC&R §6.1).

Examples that usually require ARC review:

- New buildings / outbuildings  
- Room additions  
- Major exterior remodels  
- New fences or walls visible from common areas

### ARC Approval Is Not Automatically Required For:

- Routine maintenance (e.g., repainting existing colors, repairing damaged siding)  
- Non-building items not covered by CC&R 4.19 or similar sections  
- Prefabricated, non-permanent items that don’t meet the definition of a “building” and have no construction plans  

---

## 2. ARC Timelines (CCR §6.5)

This section is one of the strongest tools homeowners have.

- The ARC must issue a **written decision within 20 working days** of receiving all required materials.  
- If the ARC does **not** issue written approval or denial within **60 days**, the application is **deemed approved by default**.

> If you don't get a written decision, you're not in limbo forever. The CC&Rs give you a way out.

### 📅 ARC Timeline Assistant

Use the **ARC Timeline Assistant** on the [community homepage](https://owners.oakhillsettlement.homes) to automatically calculate your key dates:
- Enter your submission date
- See when the 20-working-day decision is due
- Track your 60-day auto-approval date
- Monitor days remaining in real-time

Always keep:

- A copy of your ARC submission  
- The date you submitted it  
- Any response (or lack thereof)

## 3. Violation Notices

A proper violation notice should:

- Cite the **exact CC&R or rule allegedly violated**  
- Describe the **facts clearly** (what, where, when)  
- State your **right to appeal / request a hearing**  
- Give you a **clear timeframe** to respond

When notices:

- Omit the appeal right  
- Misdescribe the location or nature of the issue  
- Cite inapplicable CC&R sections  

…they are **procedurally defective** and may not be enforceable as written.

## 4. Appeals & Hearings

Appeal hearings are serious. Think of them as:

> A quasi-judicial process where anything you say can be used against you later.

### What Should Happen

- You receive a written notice explaining your right to a hearing.  
- You request the hearing **in writing**, within the stated window.  
- A hearing is scheduled **within the timelines in the Bylaws**.  
- You get a fair chance to present your position.  
- The Board issues a decision in writing.

### What Has Sometimes Happened Instead

- Hearings scheduled **outside** the required timeline.  
- No appeal rights mentioned in initial notices.  
- New CC&R sections introduced for the first time at the hearing.  
- Management or Board members **changing their recollection** of prior conversations.  
- Heavy reliance on a catch-all “discretion” clause (like §6.6) to justify a decision.

## 5. How to Protect Yourself in the Process

- **Record calls** (Oregon is a one-party consent state) or take detailed notes.  
- **Immediately follow up calls with an email**:  
  > “Per our phone conversation today, you stated that…”

- Request that all alleged violations be:
  - Put in writing  
  - Tied to **specific CC&R sections**  
  - Corrected if they mischaracterize facts (e.g., wrong location, wrong type of structure)

- Bring:
  - Your own printed copy of the CC&Rs  
  - A timeline of events  
  - Copies of every notice and your responses  
  - Photos or diagrams if relevant
