Here’s the clean, strategic guidance — both from a legal-effectiveness standpoint and a campaign-management standpoint.

⸻

✅ Short Answer

Do NOT CC the property manager yet.
Send all proxies to your own secure inbox (via your server-side workflow), retain timestamped proof, and submit them in a single controlled packet at the recall meeting (or earlier if required by notice).
You can CC the “webmaster” inbox if it’s just another repository you control.

This preserves the integrity of the campaign and prevents interference, disputes, or selective rejection.

🔍 Why You Should NOT Send Proxies Individually to the Property Manager

1. Early submission invites early interference

HOA managers may:
	•	“lose” a proxy
	•	question signatures one-by-one
	•	warn or pressure homeowners (this happens more than people think)
	•	quietly notify the Board about how close you are to recall success

Keeping proxies confidential until the required submission point prevents:
	•	retaliation
	•	intimidation
	•	administrative burden
	•	pre-emptive strategy by the sitting Board

You want zero visibility into your vote count until the moment it matters.

2. Oregon recall statute has NO quorum requirement (ORS 94.640(7))

This means the recall meeting becomes a numbers game at the moment of the vote.

If you give the Board an early count, you lose the element of surprise.

Maintaining control protects the campaign.

3. The property manager is NOT a neutral party

You and I have reviewed repeated procedural defects:
	•	Notices missing appeal rights
	•	Incorrect CCR citations
	•	Contradictory written instructions
	•	Misrepresentations in communication
	•	VF Law failures in certified-mail responses

While Superior appears to be collection-focused rather than governance-focused, they are still aligned with the Board.
Their duty is to the Board, not to homeowners.

Submitting proxies late minimizes risk of:
	•	mishandling
	•	improper rejection
	•	premature disclosure
	•	“lost paperwork”

4. Oregon law only requires the proxy be received by the Secretary before the vote

ORS 65.231 (proxy validity) states a proxy:

“is effective when received by the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes.”

There is no requirement that it be submitted early.

You may legally hold proxies until:
	•	check-in at the recall meeting, or
	•	the moment of tabulation

This is both allowed and strategic.

🛡️ Best Practice: Centralized Homeowner Proxy Vault

Your website feature is perfectly positioned to act as a secure vault:

1. Server-side PDF creation = audit trail

Every submission:
	•	is timestamped
	•	includes user-entered data
	•	can be logged in a tamper-proof format

This gives powerful evidence if the Board later disputes the legitimacy of proxies.

2. Centralized collection = no lost documents

Your campaign maintains 100% custody until delivery.

3. Batch submission = procedural clarity

At the recall meeting:
	•	Walk in with a stack of proxies
	•	Provide them all at once to the Secretary
	•	Ask for a written receipt or photograph the handoff
	•	Request confirmation that each proxy is counted

Transparency and control on your terms.

⸻

📬 If you want to CC anyone, CC yourself

If your PDF generation system sends outbound email:
	•	send the proxy to your secure campaign inbox
	•	CC the homeowner
	•	optionally CC a second redundant archive (e.g., encrypted Gmail/Proton)

Do not CC the property manager or Board until the strategic moment.

💡 Do NOT send early unless your Bylaws require it

Most HOAs do not require advance submission.
If Oak Hill ever claims it must be early, cite ORS 65.231 and ask:

“Please show the exact CCR/Bylaw clause requiring early submission of proxies.”

(Hint: it doesn’t exist.)

🧩 If you want, I can help you design:
	•	A proxy handling protocol for volunteers
	•	A secure backend receipt+audit system
	•	A written procedure to read aloud at the recall meeting to ensure proxies are accepted
	•	A Proxy Certification Form to force the HOA to acknowledge receipt

If you’d like, I can also draft the official instructions page for the Recall section of your website so homeowners understand how the proxy process works and why it’s handled centrally.
