# Oak Hill Settlement Website Updates

> **Corrected October 2026.** This log describes the November 2024 launch and is kept as history. Two of its claims were wrong and have been fixed on the site: the "2011 federal case" is *Porras v. Vial Fotheringham LLP* (D. Or. 2015), which did not rule that the HOA lacks a fining mechanism, and a recall takes 59 owners to call the meeting and 98 votes to remove a director, not 10% with no quorum. See `docs/ai-context.md` for the current facts.

## Summary

I've integrated the HOA governance context from `docs/ai-context.md` throughout the website ecosystem, creating a comprehensive homeowner education and empowerment platform.

## 🎯 Key Changes

### 1. AI Assistant Enhanced Context

**File:** `apps/owners/src/app/api/chat/route.ts`

The AI assistant now has deep knowledge of:
- **2011 Federal Case**: VF Law lost case; HOA had no valid fining mechanism
- **2012 Fine Declaration**: Posted without homeowner vote, questionable validity
- **Procedural Defects**: Documented patterns of defective notices
- **Homeowner Rights**: ORS 94 protections, appeal rights, timelines
- **Board Recall**: 10% petition, no quorum requirement
- **ARC Timeline**: 20-day decision, 60-day auto-approval
- **Routine Maintenance**: No ARC approval needed

The AI can now:
- Identify procedurally defective notices
- Explain the 2011 federal case significance
- Guide homeowners through appeal processes
- Clarify what requires ARC approval vs. what doesn't
- Explain Board limitations under Oregon law

### 2. New "Know Your Rights" Page

**File:** `apps/owners/src/app/rights/page.tsx`

Created comprehensive homeowner rights guide featuring:

#### Critical Historical Context Banner
- 2011 Federal Court ruling (no valid fining mechanism)
- VF Law's continued representation
- 2012 Fine Declaration (unvoted)

#### Content Sections
1. **Governance Hierarchy** - CC&Rs → Bylaws → Declarations → Guidelines
2. **Board Can/Cannot Do** - Clear side-by-side comparison
3. **ARC Timeline Requirements** - 20-day decision, 60-day auto-approval
4. **Board Recall Rights** - 10% threshold, no quorum, ORS 94.640(7)
5. **Spotting Defective Notices** - Red flags for homeowners
6. **Your Rights Summary** - Quick reference card

#### Design Features
- Accessible contrast ratios (WCAG AA/AAA)
- Visual hierarchy with color-coded sections
- Call-to-action links to Documents and AI Assistant
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Dark mode support

### 3. Navigation Updates

Added "Your Rights" link to navigation across all pages:
- `apps/owners/src/app/page.tsx` - Homepage
- `apps/owners/src/app/documents/page.tsx` - Documents page
- `apps/owners/src/app/chat/page.tsx` - AI Chat page
- `apps/owners/src/app/rights/page.tsx` - Rights page itself

### 4. Homepage Enhancements

**File:** `apps/owners/src/app/page.tsx`

Updated "Homeowner Resources" section to prioritize rights:
- "Know Your Rights under ORS 94" listed first
- Two CTAs: "Know Your Rights" (primary) and "View Documents" (secondary)
- Updated resource links to emphasize empowerment

### 5. Recall Site Updates

**File:** `apps/recall/src/app/page.tsx`

Enhanced advocacy messaging:
- References documented patterns of overreach
- Mentions 10% recall threshold
- Encourages challenging defective notices
- Links to main hub for detailed rights information
- Footer cross-references to owners site

### 6. Shared Context Package

**File:** `packages/config/hoa-context.ts`

Created programmatic access to HOA context:

```typescript
import { hoaContext } from '@oakhillsettlement/config';

// Access structured information
hoaContext.criticalHistory.federalCase2011
hoaContext.homeownerRights.ors94Protections.boardRecall
hoaContext.documentedPatterns.proceduralDefects
```

Benefits:
- Type-safe access to context
- Reusable across apps
- Single source of truth
- Easy to maintain and update

### 7. Documentation

**File:** `docs/README.md`

Created comprehensive documentation:
- How context is shared across apps
- Maintenance guidelines
- Cross-references between sites
- Legal considerations
- Version control practices

## 📊 Information Architecture

```
docs/ai-context.md (Source of Truth)
       ↓
       ├─→ AI System Prompts (Both apps)
       ├─→ /rights Page Content
       ├─→ packages/config/hoa-context.ts
       └─→ Website Messaging
```

## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### Homeowner Journey

1. **Discovery** → Lands on owners.oakhillsettlement.homes
2. **Education** → Reads "Know Your Rights" page
3. **Research** → Reviews governing documents in /documents
4. **Questions** → Uses AI assistant in /chat
5. **Action** → Visits recall site for organizing recall campaign

### Information Consistency

All touchpoints now reference:
- Same historical facts (2011 case)
- Same legal protections (ORS 94)
- Same procedural requirements
- Same Board limitations

## 🔍 Key Facts Now Highlighted

### The 2011 Federal Case
- **What**: VF Law sued homeowner for fines
- **Outcome**: Court ruled HOA had NO fining authority
- **Significance**: Same attorney still represents HOA
- **Current Impact**: 2012 Fine Declaration never voted on

### Homeowner Protections
- **Board Recall**: Only 10% of owners needed
- **ARC Timeline**: 20 days for decision, 60 for auto-approval
- **Appeal Rights**: Must be in ALL enforcement notices
- **Routine Maintenance**: NO ARC approval needed

### Documented Patterns
- Missing CC&R citations
- Incorrect property descriptions
- Missing appeal rights notices
- False ARC requirements for maintenance
- Expansion of authority beyond CC&Rs
