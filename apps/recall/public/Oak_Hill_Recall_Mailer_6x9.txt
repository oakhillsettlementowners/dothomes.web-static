Oak Hill Settlement Homeowners
A Recall Petition Is Underway

We are fellow homeowners working to restore governance grounded in our CC&Rs and Oregon law.

The Facts You Should Know

In 2011, a federal court ruled that Oak Hill's CC&Rs did not contain a valid fining system, and that VF Law, the same firm the HOA uses today, violated federal law when collecting fines.

After that ruling, the Board created a 2012 "Fine & Enforcement Declaration." But homeowners were never given a vote. It was never adopted as a proper CC&R amendment. The membership never approved it.

That declaration may not be legally enforceable—yet it is still used in violation notices today.

What Homeowners Are Experiencing
	• Violation notices that fail to mention appeal rights (required by Bylaws §4.15)
	• Claims that routine maintenance requires ARC approval (it doesn't—see CC&R §4.2)
	• Requirements not found in governing documents (e.g., "licensed and insured contractors" for routine maintenance)
	• Fines based on the 2012 Declaration that homeowners never voted on

Your Right to Recall

Under Oregon law (ORS 94.640), homeowners can remove Board members through a democratic process:
	• Only 10% of owners needed to petition for a recall vote
	• Recall meetings have no quorum requirement
	• This right supersedes the bylaws and exists precisely to prevent overreach

What This Effort Is About

This is about ensuring enforcement is grounded in the CC&Rs—not invented requirements—and that homeowners receive the procedural protections Oregon law guarantees.

When the Board acts beyond its authority, homeowners have the right—and the responsibility—to act.

Join your neighbors. Sign the petition. Hold leadership accountable.
